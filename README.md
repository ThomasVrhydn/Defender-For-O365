# Defender-For-O365

**info**

During my work with customers, when I explain the tenant allow and block features in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P1/P2, I often get the question: why did Microsoft make this so hard to understand? That comment gave me the idea to create a visual representation of the features to make them easier to understand.
